Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God.[25] But Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him![26] And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.[27] And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.[28] And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.[29]And immediately he left the synagogue, and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.[30] Now Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him of her.[31] And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her; and she served them.[32]That evening, at sundown, they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons.[33] And the whole city was gathered together about the door.[34] And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.[35]And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose and went out to a lonely place, and there he prayed.[36] And Simon and those who were with him pursued him,[37] and they found him and said to him, Every one is searching for you.[38] And he said to them, Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also; for that is why I came out.[39] And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.[40]And a leper came to him beseeching him, and kneeling said to him, If you will, you can make me clean.[41] Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, I will; be clean.[42] And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.[43] And he sternly charged him, and sent him away at once,[44] and said to him, See that you say nothing to any one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to the people.[45] But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in the country; and people came to him from every quarter.";

It is blasphemy! Who can forgive sins but God alone?[8] And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, Why do you question thus in your hearts?[9] Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Rise, take up your pallet and walk'?[10] But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins -- he said to the paralytic --[11] I say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home.[12] And he rose, and immediately took up the pallet and went out before them all; so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, We never saw anything like this![13]He went out again beside the sea; and all the crowd gathered about him, and he taught them.[14] And as he passed on, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, Follow me. And he rose and followed him.[15]And as he sat at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were sitting with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many who followed him.[16] And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?[17] And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.[18]Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and people came and said to him, Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?[19] And Jesus said to them, Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.[20] The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.[21] No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made.[22] And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost, and so are the skins; but new wine is for fresh skins.[23]One sabbath he was going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain.[24] And the Pharisees said to him, Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?[25] And he said to them, Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him:[26] how he entered the house of God, when Abi'athar was high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him?[27] And he said to them, The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath;[28] so the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.";

But they were silent.[5] And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, Stretch out your hand. He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.[6] The Pharisees went out, and immediately held counsel with the Hero'di-ans against him, how to destroy him.[7]Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed; also from Judea[8] and Jerusalem and Idume'a and from beyond the Jordan and from about Tyre and Sidon a great multitude, hearing all that he did, came to him.[9] And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they should crush him;[10] for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him.[11] And whenever the unclean spirits beheld him, they fell down before him and cried out, You are the Son of God.[12] And he strictly ordered them not to make him known.[13]And he went up on the mountain, and called to him those whom he desired; and they came to him.[14] And he appointed twelve, to be with him, and to be sent out to preach[15] and have authority to cast out demons:[16] Simon whom he surnamed Peter;[17] James the son of Zeb'edee and John the brother of James, whom he surnamed Bo-aner'ges, that is, sons of thunder;[18] Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,[19] and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.Then he went home;[20] and the crowd came together again, so that they could not even eat.[21] And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for people were saying, He is beside himself.[22] And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He is possessed by Be-el'zebul, and by the prince of demons he casts out the demons.[23] And he called them to him, and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?[24] If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.[25] And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.[26] And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end.[27] But no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man; then indeed he may plunder his house.[28]Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter;[29] but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin --[30] for they had said, He has an unclean spirit.[31]And his mother and his brothers came; and standing outside they sent to him and called him.[32] And a crowd was sitting about him; and they said to him, Your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you.[33] And he replied, Who are my mother and my brothers?[34] And looking around on those who sat about him, he said, Here are my mother and my brothers![35] Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and mother.";

And a very large crowd gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea; and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land.[2] And he taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them:[3] Listen! A sower went out to sow.[4] And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.[5] Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil;[6] and when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root it withered away.[7] Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.[8] And other seeds fell into good soil and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.[9] And he said, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.[10]And when he was alone, those who were about him with the twelve asked him concerning the parables.[11] And he said to them, To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables;[12] so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand; lest they should turn again, and be forgiven.[13] And he said to them, Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?[14] The sower sows the word.[15] And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown; when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word which is sown in them.[16] And these in like manner are the ones sown upon rocky ground, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;[17] and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away.[18] And others are the ones sown among thorns; they are those who hear the word,[19] but the cares of the world, and the delight in riches, and the desire for other things, enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.[20] But those that were sown upon the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.[21]And he said to them, Is a lamp brought in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed, and not on a stand?[22] For there is nothing hid, except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret, except to come to light.[23] If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.[24] And he said to them, Take heed what you hear; the measure you give will be the measure you get, and still more will be given you.[25] For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.[26]And he said, The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed upon the ground,[27] and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he knows not how.[28] The earth produces of itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.[29] But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.[30]And he said, With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it?[31] It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown upon the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth;[32] yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.[33]With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it;[34] he did not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.[35]On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, Let us go across to the other side.[36] And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. And other boats were with him.[37] And a great storm of wind arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already filling.[38] But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him and said to him, Teacher, do you not care if we perish?[39] And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace! Be still! And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.[40] He said to them, Why are you afraid?

But she could not,[20] for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he was much perplexed; and yet he heard him gladly.[21] But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and the leading men of Galilee.[22] For when Hero'di-as' daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl, Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will grant it.[23] And he vowed to her, Whatever you ask me, I will give you, even half of my kingdom.[24] And she went out, and said to her mother, What shall I ask?

And some people brought to him a blind man, and begged him to touch him.[23] And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, Do you see anything?[24] And he looked up and said, I see men; but they look like trees, walking.[25] Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked intently and was restored, and saw everything clearly.[26] And he sent him away to his home, saying, Do not even enter the village.[27]And Jesus went on with his disciples, to the villages of Caesare'a Philip'pi; and on the way he asked his disciples, Who do men say that I am?[28] And they told him, John the Baptist; and others say, Eli'jah; and others one of the prophets.[29] And he asked them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered him, You are the Christ.[30] And he charged them to tell no one about him.[31]And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.[32] And he said this plainly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.[33] But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter, and said, Get behind me, Satan! For you are not on the side of God, but of men.[34]And he called to him the multitude with his disciples, and said to them, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.[35] For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it.[36] For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?[37] For what can a man give in return for his life?[38] For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of man also be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.";

He will come and destroy the tenants, and give the vineyard to others.[10] Have you not read this scripture: `The very stone which the builders rejectedhas become the head of the corner;[11] this was the Lord's doing,and it is marvelous in our eyes'?[12]And they tried to arrest him, but feared the multitude, for they perceived that he had told the parable against them; so they left him and went away.[13]And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Hero'di-ans, to entrap him in his talk.";

And they reproached her.[6] But Jesus said, Let her alone; why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.[7] For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you will, you can do good to them; but you will not always have me.[8] She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burying.[9] And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.[10]Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them.[11] And when they heard it they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him.[12]And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the passover lamb, his disciples said to him, Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the passover?[13] And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him,[14] and wherever he enters, say to the householder, `The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I am to eat the passover with my disciples?'[15] And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us.[16] And the disciples set out and went to the city, and found it as he had told them; and they prepared the passover.[17]And when it was evening he came with the twelve.";

See how many charges they bring against you.[5] But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate wondered.[6]Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked.[7] And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barab'bas.[8] And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he was wont to do for them.[9] And he answered them, Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?[10] For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up.[11] But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barab'bas instead.[12] And Pilate again said to them, Then what shall I do with the man whom you call the King of the Jews?[13] And they cried out again, Crucify him.[14] And Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? But they shouted all the more, Crucify him.[15] So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barab'bas; and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.[16]And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the praetorium); and they called together the whole battalion.[17] And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on him.[18] And they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews![19] And they struck his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and they knelt down in homage to him.[20] And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak, and put his own clothes on him.

He has risen, he is not here; see the place where they laid him.[7] But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.[8] And they went out and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them; and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.[9]Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.[10] She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.[11] But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it.[12]After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country.[13] And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.[14]Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they sat at table; and he upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen.[15] And he said to them, Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation.[16] He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.[17] And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;[18] they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.[19]So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.[20] And they went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it.
